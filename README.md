# Description
This is an Augmented Reality (AR) application developed for android. The purpose of this application is to improve the user experience of the Hotel and Hospitality industry. This project was developed as part of the Mixed Reality Application Development (MXRT) Project.

- AR Room Preview
- AR Graffiti

To access these features, you must navigate to the "recently viewed" tab in the main menu, and select on the corresponding option.

# AR Room Preview
This is a feature that allows users to preview a hotel room before booking. Clicking on the screen when near an "i" icon would allow users to view more information about that item in the room. The user can also reset their AR session by clicking on the reset button at the top, or hide the user interface to get a better view of the facility. 

# AR Graffiti
This is a gamified activity that allows users to draw and create 3D artworks in AR. This can be good entertainment for guests with kids, and can allow guests to be creative and create their own personalized AR experiences.
